## Drawing Maps

Maps are datasets with a 2D continuous manifold, corresponding to, well,
a map.


Some possible fibers:
* snow depth: real and continuous
* measurements of snow depth: real and discrete
* names of counties: non-continuous scalars
* population: a different kind of non-continuous scalars
* time series, for example COVID cases: non-continuous in space,
  presumably continuous in time.


The key thing with maps is that the boundaries come from survey databases.

There are FIPS Codes and Census Tract Codes.
